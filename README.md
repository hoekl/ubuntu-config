# ubuntu-config

Script to simplify configuration of UoB Ubuntu 20.04 Laptops.

All setup tasks are handled automatically apart from creating the user account of the end user. This can be done via the command line as outlined in the wiki, or via the settings GUI (Users -> Add user).

User interaction is only required at the end of the script when adding another key to the LUKS keychain.
